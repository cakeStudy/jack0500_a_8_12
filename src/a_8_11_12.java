    Add a field to the BankAccount class named transactionFee for a real number representing an amount of money
    to deduct every time the user withdraws money. The default value is $0.00, but the client can change the value.
    Deduct the transaction fee money during every withdraw call (but not from deposits). Make sure that the balance
    cannot go negative during a withdrawal. If the withdrawal (amount plus transaction fee) would cause it to become
    negative, donâ€™t modify the balance at all.*/

    /*Add a toString method to the BankAccount class from the previous exercise. Your method should return a string that
    contains the account's name and balance separated by a comma and space. For example, if an account object named yana
    has the name "Yana" and a balance of 3.03, the call yana.toString() should return the string "Yana, $3.03".*/
